# [RECURSIVE FFT](https://sistenix.com/fft.html)
Software (MATLAB/Octave) and Hardware (SystemVerilog with inputs and outputs in Fixed-point format) implementation
of the forward and inverse FFT.
## Getting Started

The hardware module operates as follows:
* set sel=0, to compute the forward transform 
* set sel=1, to compute the inverse transform
